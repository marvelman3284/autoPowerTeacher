## Automatic Power Teacher
---
Searches through the DOM to automatically fill in grades stored in a spreadsheet.
Will need some adjusting to work perfectly with powerteacher as it is currently calibrated to work with a quick html file I created for this project.

### In order to work with power teacher you (I) need:
1. the id/classnames of different powerteacher elements
2. a quick understanding of how powerteacher works
3. a better way to generate the ids, as the current method is specfically fitted to my local example. one way to work with this idea would be to have very genaric assignment names such as quiz01, test02, homeowork03, etc. Stuff that can be very easily programatically generated. 
4. probably something else that i dont know about/am forgetting
